## Christmas Market 2012

Huge thanks to everyone who supported the first ever Chapelford Christmas market - volunteers, stall holders and visitors. We estimate there were well over 2000 visitors on the day which exceeded our wildest expectations!

We raised Â£1100 profit for the Chapelford Community Centre fund.

## Chapelford Jubilee Celebration

Chapelford Jubilee Celebration took place on Monday 4th June, and encompassed the official opening ceremony for Dakota Park.

Thank you to all who attended the event, we estimate that there were more than 1000 people in attendance.
