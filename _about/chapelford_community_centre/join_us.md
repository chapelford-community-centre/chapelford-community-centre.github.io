## How can I get involved?

If you would like to get involved, put on a fund raising event, contribute skills, then please drop us a line at [info@chapelford-community-centre.co.uk](mailto:info@chapelford-community-centre.co.uk) or feel free to contact one of the directors.

We also need to develop a list of individuals/organisations that would wish to hire the centre once built, in order that we can demonstrate the need, and put together an income stream for future sustainability.

Again if this would apply to you then please get in touch.
