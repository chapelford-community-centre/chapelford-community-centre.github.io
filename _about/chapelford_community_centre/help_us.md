## How much money will we need?

Funds raised do far:
{: style="text-align: justify"}

* **Amount Raised:** £11,000
* **Target:** £500,000
* **Amount remaining to hit the target:** £489,000

We estimate that to build the centre we will need to raise in the region of £500,000.

We received a donation of £1,000 from St James Congregation when we started and a £5,000 grant from WBC West Neighbourhood Board.

We have since then been organising various events to achieve the dual objective of bringing community together and raise funds.

We hope that the whole community will come together to raise funds to build the centre. If we can demonstrate that the community are fully engaged then we stand a much better chance of securing large capital grants from grant giving organisations.
